## Contribution

The best way to contribute is to check out the current pages first, they are located in the `/docs/api` folder. If you want to update existing pages - it might be easier to just go to [the website](https://rawgthedocs.orels.sh) and click the "Edit this page!" link at the bottom to edit a particular page.

All contributions are welcome! No matter how big or small.

### Adding New Pages

The policy for the docs structure is as follows

- The docs are located in the `docs` folder
- All of the actual documentation routes are defined inside the `/api` filder
- Each folder represents one root api path (like `/users`, `/games`, etc)
- Each folder should have a single `README.md` file in it
- Each file should have all the sub paths for that root path in it

#### Example

So, let's say there is no documentation for the `/collections` route. Here's what you'll need to do

1. Fork this repo
1. Make a new folder inside `docs/api` called `collections`
1. Make a `README.md` file inside that folder
1. Add a level 1 header to the top of the file that contains the name of the route - `# /collections`. This is done for search indexing
1. Add a level 2 header for every route you want to document in the format of `METHOD_NAME` `path`, like `## GET /` or `## GET /:slug`
1. Make a PR to this repo's `master` branch

So in the end you'll have something like this in your `docs/api/collections/README.md` file

```md
# /collections

## GET /

> All collections

### Description

Returns every single collection posted on rawg

<ApiExample path="/collections" pagination />

## GET /:slug

> Single collection

### Description

Returns a collection for the specified slug

<ApiExample path="/collections/:slug" />
```

And that's pretty much it!

### ApiExample Component

The beating heart of this documentation system is the `ApiExample` vue component that allows you to quickly insert a demo widget for any api route you want and generate documentation for it.

The goal is to get rid of static jsons that get outdated quickly and provide those interested in the API with a simple way to explore the resources of rawg.io.

Main features of the component:

- Allows to quickly copy the urls
- Shows the responses with proper syntax highlighting
- Supports path paramaters and generates customizable fields for them
- Supports query paramaters and generates customizable fields for them
- Allows to pass extra documentation information for query params as placeholders
- Allows to toggle query paramaters on and off (useful for boolean params)

Any other info that you need to tell to the potential API user should just be written in plain Markdown below. As a huge proponent of simple systems, I'm certain that it's better than making even more fancy generators than there currently are.

#### Usage

You can insert `ApiExample` in any of the markdown files wherever you feel it should go. My general rule was to put it right below the basic description so far.

##### Generate example for `/api/games`

```md
<ApiExample path="/games" />
```

##### Generate example for `/api/users/<someUserSlug>/games`

This will add a path parameter `user` to the configurable params list and will prefill it with a default value.

```md
<ApiExample path="/users/:user/games" />
```

##### Generate example for a paginating route

This will add `page` and `page_size` to the query parameters list. This one was extracted to a boolean prop as it is used a lot.

```md
<ApiExample path="/users/:user/collections" pagination />
```

##### Generate example with custom query params

A lot of the API routes have some specific query parameters you can pass. In this case you will need to supply an array of those to the component. You can also combine the `query` prop with the `pagination` prop.

```md
<ApiExample
  path="/users/:user/reviews"
  :query="[
    { label: 'is_text', value: '', placeholder: 'Flag to only return reviews with text, value not required' }
  ]"
/>
```

Note that `:query` has a colon in front of it, it is very important to have it there, or vue would treat the query value as a string and not an array!

You can pass some default value to `value` if you want it there, but it would mean that user won't see the documentation part in the placeholder.

This component will probably get expanded down the line, as more documentation gets added. I will try to keep this readme up-to-date on that.
