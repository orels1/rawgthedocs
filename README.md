## Contribution

The best way to contribute is to check out the current pages first, they are located in the `/docs/api` folder. If you want to update existing pages - it might be easier to just go to [the website](https://rawgthedocs.orels.sh) and click the "Edit this page!" link at the bottom to edit a particular page.

All contributions are welcome! No matter how big or small.
